# Optical-Tweezers-with-AODs

Greetings,

here you can find a small selection of optical tweezer pictures taken in the Hamburg Ytterbium Lab during the course of my master thesis. I hope you enjoy them! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Additionally, a video is shown with real time footage of row wise sorting with AOD optical tweezers without atoms. The static optical tweezers are generated with an SLM.

Wavelength of AOD tweezer: 532 nm
Wavelength of SLM tweezer: 759 nm
